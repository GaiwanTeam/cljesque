Clojure wrapper for Jesque

## Features

- Job queue on top of Redis thanks to Jesque
- Define jobs as simple Clojure functions
- Idiomatic Clojure API

<!-- installation -->
## Installation

To use the latest release, add the following to your `deps.edn` ([Clojure CLI](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli))

```
co.gaiwan/cljesque {:mvn/version "0.2.4"}
```

or add the following to your `project.clj` ([Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/))

```
[co.gaiwan/cljesque "0.2.4"]
```
<!-- /installation -->

## Rationale

Many projects need some kind of task runner for doing background processes. In
the Ruby world Resque is a very common solution to this, Jesque is a compatible
Java port. This project makes it a bit easier to work with from Clojure.

The Java version expects you to create a new class for each Job type. We hijack
the classname field to instead store the fully qualified name of a Clojure
function (var), which gets resolved (via requiring-resolve) on the worker.

You can spin up any number of worker machines/processes, as long as they can
reach redis, and can load the necessary functions.

Since Jesqueue is compatible with Resqueue, you can use
[Resqueue-web](https://github.com/resque/resque-web) as dashboard UI. 

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[co.gaiwan.cljesque :as q])

;; Set up Redis connection pool and Jesque client
(def client (q/connect))
;; OR
(def client (q/connect {:host "127.0.0.1" :port 6379))

;; "Job" function
(defn test-fn [inj arg1 arg2]
  (println "TEST" inj arg1 arg2))

;; Schedule jobs
(dotimes [i 10]
  (q/enqueue client "test-queue" `test-fn "first-arg" (str "second-arg-" i)))
  
;; Run a worker
(def injected-values {... db,config etc ...})
(q/run-worker! client ["test-queue"] injected-values)

;; Check what's in the queue(s)
(q/queue-infos client)
